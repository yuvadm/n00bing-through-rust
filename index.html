## Baby steps

- [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
  - Book is a great reference for specific concepts
  - That's it.
- [https://exercism.io/tracks/rust](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust)
  - Exercism is a good *exercise*
- But I need a real-world project...

# Slinging media files over UPnP

- Reverse engineering a cheap HDMI/UPnP dongle

# UPnP Casting

- Send a UPnP discovery packet over **UDP** broadcast
- Dongle on LAN responds with some fugly **XML**
- Serve the media file over **HTTP**
- Send an XML request to the dongle pointing to the file
- Send play/pause actions as neccesary

You can implement this with several dozen lines of Python/JS (or any other modern "dynamic" language)

# UPnP Casting

## Dependencies

- `clap` for CLI
- `hyper` for HTTP calls
- `tokio-fs` for serving the static file
- `tokio-io` for handling UDP traffic
- `tokio` for wrapping it all in one runtime
- `futures`  because... you need it

It's on [https://github.com/yuvadm/slingr](https://github.com/yuvadm/slingr)

# RTL-SDR

- A very cool piece of hardware used as *poor man's Software Defined Radio*
  - [SDR Intro talk at PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJOFaOM2wUc) (not really a Python talk)
- Reference library implemented in C + heavy usage of `libusb`
- Let's do an exercise rewrite!

# `impl RtlSdr`

- C **is** the original systems programming language
- Writing low-level code gives you a much better grasp of the language vs. C
- Personal anecdote:
  - *really* hard to stop thinking in OOP terms
  - Especially not having **inheritance** in your toolkit

Work in progress at [https://github.com/yuvadm/rustl-sdr/](https://github.com/yuvadm/rustl-sdr/)
