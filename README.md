# Starting with Rust

## Abstract

### N00bing Through Rust

The Rust language no doubt has a steep learning curve.
In this talk I will share my experience of getting started with Rust in addition to some ideas that can be applied to making things easier for Rust beginners.

Yuval Adam is a full stack developer, freelance consultant and a Rustacean in the making

## Ideas

- High-level mess vs. low-level "fun"
- Find the right motivation
- "Rewrite everything" as
- Be comfortable with being a n00b
- Ultimate goal: learn idiomatic code as fast as possible
- Find the right mentors
